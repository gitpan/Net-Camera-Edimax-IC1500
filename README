Net-Camera-Edimax-IC1500 1.008
=====================================

This module provides a means of interfacing with the Edimax IC1500
series network cameras through Perl.

The module was written because I needed a convenient and scriptable
way of changing the image settings on the cameras. The settings
that work well during the day, for example, are no good at night, and
so writing a module that I could then use to script something, along
with cron, was the obvious way forward.

This module should work against anything in the IC1500 series - in fact,
it was developed against an IC1500Wg. If you do notice any issues, please
do not hesistate to raise them.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires LWP, for obvious reasons.
